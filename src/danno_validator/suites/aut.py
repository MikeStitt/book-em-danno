"""Harness-under-test resolution shared by the sweep and the benchmark runner.

Maps a `--harness` name to (1) the prebuilt sandbox image to provision, (2) the
post-provision install step (claurst is not a prebuilt image), and (3) the `TurnFn`
that drives a turn. These are now thin lookups into the harness registry
(`danno_validator.harnesses`), so `danno bench` and `danno validate` resolve the
HUT identically and adding a harness needs no edit here — the registry owns the
per-harness behavior (see `.docs/plan-harness-api.md`).
