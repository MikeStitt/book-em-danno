"""The benchmark-task abstraction: `BenchTask` + `BenchVerdict` + the run loop.

A `BenchTask` generalises `level2.Level2Task` to externally-sourced benchmark
instances: it seeds an instance into the mounted workspace, exposes the prompt the
agent is given, resets the instance between agent runs, and grades by running the
instance's own tests in the VM. `run_bench_task` drives one task against one
harness-under-test (a `TurnFn`) and composes the result with the shared oracle, so a
benchmark row reads on the same axes as an L2 row (side-effect pass/fail + tool
calls + latency).
